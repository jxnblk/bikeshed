# Bikeshed

What color should we paint this thing?

## Features

- Endless debate over the color of something that doesn’t really matter
- Safely ignore the reactor core design, because who even knows
- Potential for last minute poop-and-swoop from key stakeholders
- Designed by committee, because everyone knows what they’re doing
- Frequent updates and unnecessary changes

## Getting Started

```js
npm install @jxnblk/bikeshed
```

```js
const bikeshed = require('@jxnblk/bikeshed')

const color = bikeshed()
// returns a random hex color string
```
